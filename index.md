Crunchyroll Auto Skip PRO does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data.

The extension runs entirely in the user’s browser and only interacts with Crunchyroll pages to control video playback.

Public APIs (AniSkip and AniList) are used only to retrieve anime skip timestamps and metadata. No user-identifiable information is collected or shared.
